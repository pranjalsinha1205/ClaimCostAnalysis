## üßæ SQL Queries Summary

Key SQL operations included:
- `GROUP BY` for smoker, region, sex
- `CASE` to derive `age_group`
- `ROW_NUMBER()` to calculate **median**
- `ORDER BY` + `LIMIT` for top claimants
- `JOIN` and `VIEW` creation for Power BI

```sql
-- Sample: Avg claim by region
SELECT region, ROUND(AVG(claim_cost), 2) AS avg_claim_cost
FROM insurance
GROUP BY region;
